## 10/12/2025 1 AM - Started researching and schematic

I started by finding out which processor I wanted to use! This was the main component, so I decided to choose something cost effective, but also powerful! Thats when I had my eyes on the RK3566, which conveniently had a symbol and footprint already on SnapEDA! 
I also researched my RAM on LCSC, when I found a beautiful SK Hynix RAM module for a extremely cheap price! 16GB of RAM, LPDDR4 at that, for less than $20!
Using my prior knowledge and skills, I checked the datasheets (I hate you Rockchip for not giving a solid datasheet) and pin mapped to the appropriate areas.
It's around 1 am right now, and I still didn't finish the RAM schematic, so I'm aiming to do the RAM and power schema tommorow!  

## 10/12/2025 11 AM - Finished LPDDR4 RAM schematic!  

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTgxMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--0423c85fd8bc2a83442d7ea7c391dc94071dadf4/image.png)

So from my goals last night, I immediately woke up to finish the RAM schematic. It was easier than anticipated, as the processor had dedicated pins for LPDDR4! 
I also fixed up the schematic a bit, as it was really messy, and there was unneeded text everywhere... 
I'll probably do either the eMMC portion, or the power section next, depending on my mood lol..
I will say that I haven't tried routing out everything, but it seems to be ridiculously annoying...  

## 10/12/2025 7 PM - Started the routing for LPDDR4 RAM  

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTg5NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--d05cfd5bbf2f8fc7fd101b3e63ef94f8ebef35b6/image.png)

Hey guys! After finishing the schematic, I started routing the LPDDR4 RAM, and its safe to say that this was a real difficulty. I only routed two byte groups and it was ridiculously cramped...

I finished all of the data lines for the first two byte groups, so onto the address lines and the other byte groups :///
  

## 10/12/2025 10 PM - I have prayed to the BGA gods and they have answered!!!  

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTkzNSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--384ea1438b0e649a43cc04640c4afb04972cef60/image.png)

Yes.
I finished the RAM routing.
My back hurts.
Okay so since there need to be detail...
I routed the rest of the Address and byte lines, as long as the clock lines. The processor is really iffy since the BGA pins are all over the place, so I had to really use the three layers wisely. My clock traces are 33mm, which is absolutely crazy...
I tried my best to length match the groups (bytes and address) and I achieved a max skew of +-.5mm, which is actually pretty good! 
Next, I will probably do the power section, and the decoupling caps for the RAM and RK3566.  

## 10/13/2025 - Added RAM decoupling caps  

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjExNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2602318c94931495c60faac79d95d1188c0f91a2/image.png)

Yeah so I was out the whole day so heres my progress...
I had to squeeze a lot of the decoupling caps onto the RAM since it has a absurdly crazy amount of power pins. Most of the caps are on the back since they allow for the shortest return path.
A lot, and I mean alot of via in pad was used... 
I had the signal traces from the address and byte lines, which made it annoying to fit the caps (less than 0.07mm spacing), so some of the caps are a bit far away...
Alright tomorrow I plan to add the decoupling caps to the processor, and start on the power section schematic.
P.S a total of 40 decoupling caps were used....  

## 10/18/2025 - Rerouted RAM   

![Screenshot 2025-10-18 at 12.12.25 PM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzAwOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8313ee095ce7efcd3f9712a708a748f96aa6c7c8/Screenshot%202025-10-18%20at%2012.12.25%E2%80%AFPM.png)

It's been around a week since the last update, I was super duper swamped with work. Anyways, I cleaned up some the of the routing, and added two more layers, as I wanted a really clean and concise layer for the differential pairs! 

I had to move a couple of traces around, but there weren't much changes.  

## 10/31/2025 4 PM - Added EMMC storage!  

![Screenshot 2025-10-31 at 4.50.43 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzE4MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--0c0a1fa3b5a00016fae33542d0d131940f39e2f0/Screenshot%202025-10-31%20at%204.50.43%E2%80%AFPM.png)

I started off this session by researching about the types of memory commonly used in compute modules. It seemed that EMMC was the most cheapest, but efficient type!

I checked the specs of my CPU, and saw that it supported the 5.1 EMMC interface, so I inputted these parameters into LCSC.
A couple of brands came up, most notably Sandisk and SAMSUNG. I opted for SAMSUNG, since it was a bit more cost efficient, and it was extremely reputable. 
After searching a bit for the symbol and footprint, Snapmagic had the exact product, which was super duper great!

I just checked the datasheet, linked up pins, added needed discrete components, etc, etc.  

## 10/31/2025 5 PM - Routed the EMMC!  

![Screenshot 2025-10-31 at 4.57.31 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzE4NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--927c41cf95d4c1a51f1b2fa1062074d57e93bae1/Screenshot%202025-10-31%20at%204.57.31%E2%80%AFPM.png)

After making the schematic, I just was left with all of the routing. The EMMC had only a few pins, so it was decently easy to route. I still had to impedance and length match the data and clock traces, but it was chill (only 8 pins to group together).

I revised my routing a couple of times, until I got the most efficient way that won't cover the other pins that I need to fanout.

I placed my decoupling caps and pullup resistors in a nearby area, usually on top or very close to the pins. 

Next, I'll be tackling the ethernet transreciever!  

## 11/2/2025 6:39 PM - Finished the RGMII Ethernet Transceiver Schematic  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzkxMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--eef135050eb13bddf567ff2b38a82eb2a1f4be33/image.png)

For this journal entry, I'll be talking a bit on how I made this design. After taking a look at Realtek's datasheets, most of the CPU pins were perfectly mapped out, and had a dedicated function for Ethernet RGMII, which made everything a whole lot easier.

A couple of pullups and pulldowns were needed in order to make sure that the signal was either clean, or was at a 0/1 state for certain settings.

Thankfully nothing was differentially required, but strict length and impedance matching was needed, which I will keep in mind when routing this IC.  

## 11/2/2025 6:42 PM - Routed the Ethernet Transceiver  

![Screenshot 2025-11-02 at 6.35.18 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzkxMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2767f0820c86d508446e6848b62f86c9c2466e37/Screenshot%202025-11-02%20at%206.35.18%E2%80%AFPM.png)

After creating the schematic, my next task was to route the IC onto the CPU. Since the pin functions were already mapped out, I didn't have to go through much iterations on pin function mapping, which saved alot of time. 

However since the BGA pins were quite dense, it was a bit annoying to fanout all of the pins (the columns/rows sit right next to each other). 

I put most of the 1/0 status signal pullups/pulldowns on the other side of the board, as well as most decoupling caps to save space, and to ensure that the return/accepting path was quick.
