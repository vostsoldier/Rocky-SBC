## 10/12/2025 1 AM - Started researching and schematic

I started by finding out which processor I wanted to use! This was the main component, so I decided to choose something cost effective, but also powerful! Thats when I had my eyes on the RK3566, which conveniently had a symbol and footprint already on SnapEDA! 
I also researched my RAM on LCSC, when I found a beautiful SK Hynix RAM module for a extremely cheap price! 16GB of RAM, LPDDR4 at that, for less than $20!
Using my prior knowledge and skills, I checked the datasheets (I hate you Rockchip for not giving a solid datasheet) and pin mapped to the appropriate areas.
It's around 1 am right now, and I still didn't finish the RAM schematic, so I'm aiming to do the RAM and power schema tommorow!  

## 10/12/2025 11 AM - Finished LPDDR4 RAM schematic!

So from my goals last night, I immediately woke up to finish the RAM schematic. It was easier than anticipated, as the processor had dedicated pins for LPDDR4! 
I also fixed up the schematic a bit, as it was really messy, and there was unneeded text everywhere... 
I'll probably do either the eMMC portion, or the power section next, depending on my mood lol..
I will say that I haven't tried routing out everything, but it seems to be ridiculously annoying...  

## 10/12/2025 7 PM - Started the routing for LPDDR4 RAM

Hey guys! After finishing the schematic, I started routing the LPDDR4 RAM, and its safe to say that this was a real difficulty. I only routed two byte groups and it was ridiculously cramped...

I finished all of the data lines for the first two byte groups, so onto the address lines and the other byte groups :///
