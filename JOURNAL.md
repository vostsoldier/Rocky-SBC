## 10/12/2025 - Started researching and schematic

I started by finding out which processor I wanted to use! This was the main component, so I decided to choose something cost effective, but also powerful! Thats when I had my eyes on the RK3566, which conveniently had a symbol and footprint already on SnapEDA! 
I also researched my RAM on LCSC, when I found a beautiful SK Hynix RAM module for a extremely cheap price! 16GB of RAM, LPDDR4 at that, for less than $20!
Using my prior knowledge and skills, I checked the datasheets (I hate you Rockchip for not giving a solid datasheet) and pin mapped to the appropriate areas.
It's around 1 am right now, and I still didn't finish the RAM schematic, so I'm aiming to do the RAM and power schema tommorow!
